        Defining this variable name provides an environment variable containing all the triggers which caused the build to run, separated by ','.
        In addition each single trigger gets available as single environment variable with the given name as prefix too:<br />
        example with all known trigger types and given variable name is 'myVar'
        <ul>
        	<li>myVar_SCMTRIGGER=true  (SCM Trigger)</li>
        	<li>myVar_TIMERTRIGGER=true (Triggered by Schedule)</li>
        	<li>myVar_MANUALTRIGGER=true (triggered by user)</li>
        	<li>myVar_UPSTREAMTRIGGER=true (triggered by upstream project)</li>
        	<li>myVar=myVar_SCMTRIGGER,myVar_TIMERTRIGGER,myVar_MANUALTRIGGER,myVar_UPSTREAMTRIGGER</li>
        </ul>
        ...unknown triggers will be added with its implementation name in upper case.
